        <h2>Water Conservation Tips for Everyone:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Fix leaky faucets: A leaky faucet can waste hundreds of gallons of water per year. Fix leaks promptly to save water and money.</li>
            <li>Shorten your showers: Long showers are one of the biggest culprits of water waste. Aim for shorter showers and consider installing a low-flow showerhead.</li>
            <li>

In the Bathroom:

Take shorter showers. A 5-minute shower uses about 25 gallons of water, while a 10-minute shower uses about 50 gallons.
Fix leaky faucets. A leaky faucet can waste up to 20 gallons of water per day.
Turn off the water while brushing your teeth or shaving.
Install a low-flow toilet. A low-flow toilet can save up to 1.5 gallons of water per flush.</li>
<li>In the Kitchen:

Only run the dishwasher and washing machine when they are full.
Defrost frozen food in the refrigerator, not under running water.
Wash fruits and vegetables in a bowl of water, not under running water.
Use a water-efficient faucet aerator.
Compost food scraps instead of using a garbage disposal.</li>
<li>Outdoors:

Water your lawn and garden in the early morning or evening to reduce evaporation.
Use a broom instead of a hose to clean driveways and sidewalks.
Install a rain barrel to collect rainwater for watering your plants.
Plant drought-resistant plants.
Check for and fix leaks in your irrigation system.</li>
        </ul>
